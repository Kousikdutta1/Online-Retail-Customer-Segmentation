The main goal is to identify major customer segments like customers that are most profitable and the ones who churned out using Unsupervised ML Clustering Algorithms to prevent further loss of customer by redefining company policies. In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transnational dataset which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. The dataset provided contains information about Invoice No, Stock Code, Description, Quantity, Invoice Date, Unit Price, Customer ID and Country for each transaction.
